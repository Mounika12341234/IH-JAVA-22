Types of Data
=============
We have two types of data.

1)Unstructured Data

2)Structured Data

1)Unstructured Data
--------------------
Data which is not in readable format is called unstructured data.

In general meaning less data is called unstructured data.

ex:
	
	201	Lakemba 	SYD	NSW   	AUS 

2)Structured Data
----------------
Data which is in readable format is called structured data.

In general, meaningfull data is called structured data.

ex:
	UnitNo  Locality	City    State   Country
	-----   --------        ----    ----    -------
	201	Lakemba 	SYD	NSW   	AUS 


Oracle
========
Oracle is one of the database which is used to store structured data.

Oracle is a product of Oracle Corporation.

Oracle is a case insensitive language.

Oracle is classified into two types.

				Oracle
		|-----------------|---------------|
		SQL				PL/SQL 
(Structured Query Language)		(Procedural / Structured Query Lang)
   Developed by IBM			Developed by Oracle corporation


Client-Server Architecture
==========================
In this architecture we will see how our data will store from frontend to backend.

Diagram: oracle1.1

FrontEnd
--------
The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.
ex:
	Java,.Net,Python,Perl and etc.

Communication Channel
-------------------
It acts like a bridge between frontend and backend.
ex:
	JDBC - Java Database Connectivity
	ODBC - Open Database Connectivity
	PDBC - Python Database Connectivity 

BackEnd
--------
The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs operation based on the instructions given by frontend is called backend. 
ex:
	Oracle, MySQL, Sybase, Teradata, NoSQL , MonogDB and etc.

Management System
==================
Management system is a software which is used to manage the database.

Management system will perform following activities very easily.

1)Adding the new data

2)Modifying the existing data 

3)Deleting the unnecessary data

4)Selecting the required data

DBMS
======
A database along with software which is used to manage the database is called database management system.

RDBMS
======
If any database which is created based on relational theories such type of database called relational database management.
ex:
	Oracle , MySQL, PostgreSQL, Teradata, DB2 and etc.

SQL
=====
SQL stands for Structured Query Language which is pronounce as SEQUEL.

It is used to interact with oracle database.

It is a command based language.

It is a case insensitive language.

Every command must starts with verbs.
ex:
	select,update,delete,merge,insert and etc.

Every command must ends with semicolon (;).

It is a developed by Mr.Codd in 1972 (by IBM).


Sub Languages of SQL
====================
We have five sub languages of SQL.

1)DDL (Data Definition Language)

2)DML (Data Manipulation Language)

3)DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve Language)

4)TCL (Transaction Control Language)

5)DCL (Data Control Language)


1)DDL (Data Definition Language)
---------------------------------
It is used to maintain the objects in database.

It is a collection of five commands.

ex:
	create,alter,drop,truncate and rename.

2)DML (Data Manipulation Language)
---------------------------------
It is used to manipulate the data which is present in database.

It is a collection of four commands.
ex:
	insert,update,delete and merge.

3)DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve Language)
----------------------------------
It is used to retrieve the data which is present in database.

It is a collection of one command.
ex:
	select 

4)TCL (Transaction Control Language)
---------------------------------
It is used to maintain the transaction of database.

It is a collection of three commands.

ex:
	commit, rollback  and savepoint.

5)DCL (Data Control Language)
------------------------------
This language is used to control the access of data to the user.

It is a collection of two commands.

ex:
	grant and revoke .
